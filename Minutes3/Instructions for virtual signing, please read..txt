I guess the easiest way for proving that we all accessed the repository is for all of us to create a .txt file
with your name and minutes3, (e.g. 'seanmayminutes3.txt.') I'll commit all the changes to the git hub site
while the dropbox account saves the changes anyway. So read the minutes and make a text file.
